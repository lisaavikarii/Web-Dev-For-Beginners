# Data Types Practice

## Instructions

Imagine you are building a shopping cart. Write some documentation on the data types that you would need to complete your shopping experience. How did you arrive at your choices?

As a user, I can see a shopping cart page in a web shop for selling fruits with following details and its data types:
- A user id: represents a String data type.
- Shopping cart: represents Array (Object) data type - to demonstrate variety of products on web shop;
- Multiple products on page(banana, orange, strawberry): each of these products represent an Object data type with their properties to show and own primitive data types - name of the product[String], product price and count of the product to be added in the cart[Numbers], button to add a product to the cart[String]);
- Cart button (to see added products to the cart): represents an Object data type with following properties and their own primitive data types: Product name [String], Product quantity added [Numbers], Product count to be changed - add more or less items [Numbers], button to remove product from a cart [String], Is this product a gift [Boolean], Subtotal amount [Numbers], Close button [String], Order now button [String].
